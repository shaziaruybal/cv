\quote{Genomic epidemiologist with expertise in population genetics,
bioinformatics, and epidemiology. I'm interested in combining these
approaches to population-based studies of infectious diseases,
particularly malaria, and more recently COVID-19. My work has involved
international collaborations in West Africa, Asia-Pacific and the
Americas, and spans applied epidemiology and capacity-building in the
field, to genetics and genomics in the lab, to the downstream analytics
using advanced approaches and digital tools. I am an avid \texttt{R}
user for data processing, visualization, communication,
reports/dashboards, shiny web applications and am passionate about open
science and the development of digital tools for research.}

For other non-traditional academic contributions, I have also developed
several \texttt{R\ Shiny} web applications to support COVID-19
surveillance efforts and \texttt{R\ flexdashboard} for real-time updates
and data visualization of both programmatic/operational aspects and
preliminary epidemiological trends as part of the coordination of
population-based field studies.

This tool makes the downstream processing, quality control and interpretation of the raw data generated from a validated COVID-19 serological assay \href{https://doi.org/10.3390/mps4040072}{(Mazhari et al 2020)} accessible to all researchers without the need for a specialist background in statistical methods and advanced programming.

\item This Shiny web application was developed during the initial vaccine roll-out in Ecuador to help individuals better understand their "priority status" to receive their COVID-19 vaccine. An algorithm was applied to calculate a priority score based on an individuals answers to a set of questions on socioeconomic status, occupation, exposure, risk behavior, comorbidities, etc. \href{https://www.elcomercio.com/actualidad/herramienta-recibir-vacuna-covid19-ecuador.html}{Newspaper article (in Spanish) \faExternalLink}

This dashboard presented anonymized and aggregated data generated from monthly screening of blood donation samples to visualize seroprevalence trends.

This dashboard was updated weekly and presented operational data (e.g. follow-up rates in each field site) that could be used by the team to plan field activies and identify any areas for improvement as well as preliminary epidemiological trends (e.g. RDT positivity, prevalence of fever). As this tool was meant for internal use within the ICEMR project, it is not publicly available.

\item This Shiny web application is in development to support laboratory researchers with little to no programming skills with a tool for downstream processing of raw data generated from several qPCR machines (e.g. Lightcyler480, Quantstudio, etc). Functions will include automatic matching of sample IDs using a user-supplied 96-well or 384-well plate map, quantification of unknown samples using the assay standard curve/positive controls (e.g. to detect malaria-positive samples) and some preliminary visualizations of the data.

\section{About me}\label{about-me}}

I am half Ecuadorian and half American, born in The Netherlands, I am
fluent in English and Spanish (beginner French and Dutch), and grew up
overseas in several countries in Africa and Latin America: Ecuador,
Tanzania, Guatemala, and Honduras. I am an Australian Permanent Resident
and have been living in Melbourne, Australia since 2014 when I moved to
pursue my PhD. Apart from my research, I am highly committed to
furthering health and development initiatives, particularly in my home
country of Ecuador. From early 2016 until the COVID-19 pandemic, I was
CEO and co-founder of the The Artisan Project, a social enterprise that
worked hand in hand with talented indigenous artisans in Ecuador. We
used fashion as a tool to create income-generating opportunities,
particularly for indigenous women, and impulse social impact and
innovation. During the COVID-19 pandemic I was actively involved as a
consultant epidemiologist providing analyses on case and testing trends,
importation dynamics, Reff calculations, among others, to the Ecuadorian
National COVID-19 Emergency Response committee - most of this work
remains unpublished due to competing political agendas and turnover of
public health officials.
